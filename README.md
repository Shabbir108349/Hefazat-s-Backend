## ⚡ Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shabbir108349/Hefazat-s-Backend
```

### Check The Health Of the Program

To check that the program  properly build and running successfully.

```bash
GET  localhost:8080/public/health-check
```
As I use Spring security , So the **health-check,signup and login** routes are expose without any authentication . But all the other routes are protected with spring security and jwt.
### Signup 
```bash
POST  localhost:8080/public/signup
```
If you want to **signup** on this application then you have to use the signup url with proper properties like **{
    "username":"shabbir",
    "password":"123"
}** a json on the request body of the url and the username should be unique.

### Login

```bash
POST localhost:8080/public/login
``` 
Now you are a part of this beautiful application , please use the **Login** url and give the proper account information at the form of a json on the request body as like **{
    "username":"shabbir",
    "password":"123"
}**. If you do this properly then  this application will give you a **JWT Token**. This token will valid for **10 Minute**.Then you can hit the other url. I am describing those  on the below.


### Basically this application can store the social media account information(Google,Facebook,Tiktok,Instagram,X,FreeFire e.t.c)

Now I am describing about this platform one by one on the below---

### To add a google account's Information

```bash
POST localhost:8080/google/add-google
```
If You want to hit the URL properly, You have to use the **JWT Token** on the authorization section  to authenticate and also give the proper details that you want to store on the database as like ---

- accountName
- firstname
- lastname
- birthday
- phone
- email

on the request body.

### To update a google account's information

```bash
PUT localhost:8080/google/update-google/{68b0b1ef1acfa0c40fcbb917}
```
To update the information of an existing account, you can use that URL and give the updated value on URL's request body . this method also jwt token to authenticate.

### To Delete a google account's information

```bash
DELETE localhost:8080/google/delete-google/{68b0b1ef1acfa0c40fcbb917}
```
To delete a Google account use that link with the **objectId** of the document. you have to use the **Jwt token** to authenticate.

This is all about  a google account Now we will talk about a Facebook account. <br>
**The Facebook's operations is totally same as the Google only the difference between them on the URL** I am giving this url on the below---

### To add a facebook account's information

```bash
POST localhost:8080/facebook/add-facebook
```

### To update an existing facebook account's information

```bash
PUT localhost:8080/facebook/update-facebook/{68b0b3881acfa0c40fcbb918}
```

### To delete an facebook account's information

```bash
DELETE localhost:8080/facebook/delete-facebook/{68b0b3881acfa0c40fcbb918}
```


Now we can also see this account information with the help of the below url.<br>
this url also needs the jwt token to bypass the security.

### To see the list of the google account
```bash
GET localhost:8080/user/get-google-list
```
### To see the list of the Facebook account

```bash
GET localhost:8080/user/get-facebook-list
```
you can also update your current application's account information. And it is possible with the help of the given url but you have to be authenticated with the jwt token.

### To update your hefazat's account information
```bash
PUT localhost:8080/user/update-user/{shabbir}
```

### To delete your hefazat's account
```bash
DELETE localhost:8080/user/delete-user/{shabbir}
```

**This is all about my application. I will also integrate features gradually**

***Have a good day and May Allah bless you and your family***
